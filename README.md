PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Problem Description
A job portal is a website where job seekers can find and apply for jobs. This exercise is about creating the schema design for a job portal website.

 

Here's the list of requirements and features you can use to design your database:

 

1. A recruiter or hiring manager is a type of user, and they can post a job that they need to hire for.

 

2. The job post will include the company, the industry, the job role, a job description, and a date from which the role is available.

 

3. The job post will include a salary range, a country, and a city.

 

4. The job post includes whether the role is in-person, fully remote, or partially remote.

 

5. The job post shows the type of role: whether it's a full-time role or part-time.

 

6. The job post also shows whether it's a permanent role or a contract role, and if contract, how long the contract is for.

 

7. A job seeker user can browse for the available jobs and can filter based on industry, country, or city. They can also search based on the job role or description.

 

8. A job seeker can apply for the role. When they apply, they upload their supporting documents such as a resume or CV.

 

9. A job seeker will need to be registered for the website, by providing their full name, email address, and phone number.
